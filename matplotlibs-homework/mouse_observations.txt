1. Despite being part of the 4 most promising regiments, Infubinol and Ceftamin
had a much higher tumor volume than the other 2 in the set, Capomulin and Ramicane.

2. The more weight a mouse has , the higher volume their average tumor was. This could be
a correlation between how big the mouse is and how much material there is for the tumor.

3. Specifically with Capomulin regime, it seems to work; however, near the end of treatment, 
tumor volume increased again. Therefore, regimen effectiveness may not be guaranteed.
