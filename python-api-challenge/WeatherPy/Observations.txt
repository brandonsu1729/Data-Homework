1. The closer you get to the equater, the hotter and drier it gets. This is not 
very surprising.

2. The northern hemisphere had a higher average wind speed than the south. Northern 
hemisphere scatter showed higher MPH values.

3. I've observed that there tends to be a larger majority of data in the Northern Hemisphere,
than in the Southern Hemisphere. Whether this is intended or not, this could
relate to there possibly being more cities above the Equator.
